# Ibuprofen Slab-slab interaction modeling

Ibuprofen crystals are known to auto-agglomerate more when grown from Ethanol compared to Heptane[1]

This is hypothesised to be caused by energetic functional groups on the dominant facets (011, 002) in the crystals grown from Ethanol, whereas the dominant facet (100) in the Heptane morphology is relatively less energetic.
